### Brief Description Of What We Do: 
In our services and on our website, we sell two services, one will to be to impersonate anyone, in fact, we can use anyone's email through the mailgun api, we can also spam your school accounts even if it is locked behind a school-email only restriction. Inpersonation using an email costs $10 dollars per-person, and spamming an inbox costs $5 dollars per-300 emails sent out since we have a limit on mailgun's api.

### More In-Depth Description Of What We Do:
In our services, we found with the mailgun api, it is possible to use a domain to impersonate any email and send out emails every few miliseconds as the fake emails. We tested multiple times and found you can make fake emails to match school emails so there is no restriction even if you have to have a school email to get messages from outside services. On our website we sell two services you can purchase, one being impersonation of any email: $10, and the other being spamming people's gmail inboxes with our bot: $5 dollars per 300 messages since there is a limit.
